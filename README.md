Notes:

* All contracts are lifelong contracts, meaning there is never free agency from a contract expiring. The team that drafts you owns your rights forever. If you are released, you may sign with another team and your rights are claimed by that team until they release you or you retire.
* Every team plays every day in the regular season.
